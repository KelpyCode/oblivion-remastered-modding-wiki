<h1>Welcome to the <strong>Oblivion Remastered Modding Wiki</strong></h1>
<p>Welcome, adventurer!</p>
<p>This wiki is dedicated to everything about <strong>modding </strong><i><strong>Oblivion Remastered</strong></i> â€” from beginner-friendly guides to deep technical research. Whether you're looking to tweak your game, create entirely new content, or dive into the inner workings of the engine, you're in the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Oblivion Remastered</strong> uses a hybrid of the <strong>Gamebryo</strong> engine and <strong>Unreal Engine 5.3</strong>, making it more complex to mod than previous titles. Modding this version requires new tools, deeper technical knowledge, and a willingness to experiment. We're here to help make that journey easier.</p>

<p>ðŸ”§ <strong>Tools and Resources:</strong> Information on essential utilities and modding software</p>
<p>ðŸ§  <strong>Technical Research:</strong> In-depth articles exploring how the game's systems work</p>
